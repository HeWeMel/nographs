    TSP solver without integer-based sets (not used and not exported)

    The following is a basic implementation of a TSP solver. It is not used
    in the library or the documentation. It is solely used to compare the
    performance of the official implementations against it.

    ---

    Traveling salesmen problem: Find the path with shortest (resp. longest) length
    (sum of edge graph) through all vertices, where each vertex is visited exactly
    once, in the form of a loop.

    _traveling_salesman_basic is a variant of the algorithm shown in the tutorial.
    It is based on the bidirectional search of shortest path.

    The *graph* needs to contain at least one outgoing edge for each of the vertices
    that occur in some edge.

    An edge weight can be positive, negative or zero. If two vertices are connected by
    two edges in opposite directions, the edges can have different graph.

    The graph does not need to be total (total means: from each vertex, there is an
    edge to all other vertices), and the algorithms profits if it is not.

    THIS VERSION IS NOT EXPORTED AND NOT USED FOR EXPORTED FUNCTIONALITY. It is
    only there as reference for the version that is based on integers and for
    the unidirectional version shown in the docs.

    :param graph: For each vertex *v* that occurs in the graph, mapping *graph*
        returns a mapping, that contains elements {w: weight} for each
        edge (v, w, weight) of the graph.
    :param zero: Neutral element of weights type w.r.t. addition
       (e.g., 1.0 for float)
    :param inf: Infinite element of weights type w.r.t. comparison
       (e.g., float("infinity") for float)
    :param find_longest: True means, find path with longest instead of shortest total
        distance
    :return: Length of the shortest path of the traveling salesman problem, and
        Iterable that yields the vertices of this path. Both are None if no
        path have been found at all (problem in graph data).
    """

    # Solve TSPs with negative weights or with search for longest travels by using
    # TSP solution for positive weights, where the weights are manipulated in a
    # specific way, and the found travel length is corrected for that afterwards

    """
    Solve TSP for non-negative weights. A dynamic programming approach, typically
    faster than brute-force, but still with exponential running time.

    The algorithm has similarities to the Heldâ€“Karp algorithm: It calculates
    intermediate results D(S, c), the minimum distance of travels starting in city 1,
    visiting all cities in S and finishing at city c (to be exact: it uses Nodes - S
    instead of S). But it uses the bidirectional Dijkstra algorithm with minimum heaps
    of  distances to steer the search: It goes from smaller D's to larger ones and thus
    can stop if the first (the smallest) total travel is found. That often avoids
    some computation work.

    Concept of the solution for the base case:
    Create problem specific search graph for doing the search with the
    traverse_shortest_paths algorithm:
    - Search graph vertex: tuple (current base graph vertex, base graph vertices
      remaining for rest of travel)
    - Search graph start vertex: tuple (arbitrary base graph vertex, all base graph
      vertices)
    - Edge in search graph: From a base graph vertex to one of the remaining vertices,
      the vertex taken out of the  remaining vertices for the search graph end vertex,
      and with the weight between the two vertices.
    - Return of Dijkstra: length of shortest travel, and path
    - Return of end result: the same, but with the base graph vertices instead of the
      complete search graph vertices
