:param already_visited: If provided, this set is used instead of an internal
    one to keep vertices (resp. their hashable ids from vertex_to_id),
    that have already been visited. This parameter can be used to get online
    access to the internal bookkeeping of visited vertices, or to preload
    vertices that should never be visited, or to provide your own way for
    storing the information that a vertex has already been visited.
