:param already_visited: If provided, this set is used instead of an internal
    one to keep vertices (resp. their hashable ids from vertex_to_id),
    that have already been visited. This parameter can be used to get online
    access to the internal bookkeeping of visited vertices, or to preload
    vertices that should never be visited.

    Attention: TraversalTopologicalSortFlex requires, that the collection
    given as argument for parameter already_visited is compatible
    (in any sense) with the collection that gear.vertex_id_set()
    returns. If you have chosen GearDefault, you can just use a dict.
    Otherwise, create the collection by calling gear.vertex_id_set() or use the
    collection that another traversal with the same gear gives as attribute
    visited.
