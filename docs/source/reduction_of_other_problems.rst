The concept
~~~~~~~~~~~

Often, we can solve some type of problem by building upon algorithms
that solve other types of problems (*problem reduction*), e.g.,
we can compute the *cosine* of some angle *a* by computing the *sine* of
*a + Ï€/2*.

When we apply problem reduction to graph analysis, three kinds of
computations can be distinguished (they do not need to happen strictly
consecutive):

1) From the original analysis problem, we construct one or more other
   analysis problems.

2) We solve these problems by existing algorithms.

3) Based on their results, we construct a result of the original analysis problem.

When we use NoGraphs in the above computation part 2, we can try to
**extend the lazy computation approach** of NoGraphs
**to other computations of the problem reduction**:

- In part 1, we might **construct the derived problems on the fly**, only when they
  are needed and **as far as they are needed in part 2**.

- In part 3, we might **fetch results from part 2** only when, and
  **as far as, they are needed** to construct the final results.

This can help to keep runtime and memory low. And it can be used to create
a kind of graph analysis that is
`even more "lazy" than that of NoGraphs alone <infinite_branching>`.
Both is demonstrated in the following sections.

.. note::

    In these sections, no new functionality of NoGraphs is shown,
    but only examples of how they can be used.
    Thus, you can safely skip one or several of them if you like.


.. _traveling_salesman_example:

Example: Traveling salesman - solved by Dijkstra Shortest Paths
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**The problem**

In a weighted, directed graph, we search for a path from some vertex back to itself.
The path needs to visit all vertices exactly once. The length
of the graph (sum of edge weights) needs to be minimal under all such paths.
This is an instance of the
`traveling salesman problem <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem>`_.

We use the graph data shown below as example: The graph has 17 vertices numbered from 0
to 16. It is a complete graph, i.e., each vertex is connected with all other vertices.
The weight of an edge from a vertex *v* to another vertex *w* is given by the value
in row *v* (top down) and column *w* (left to right).
The character '-' stands for value 9999 (it has been replaced for better readability).

This example data stems from the *TSPLIB*, a collection of benchmark instances
of the traveling salesman problem, provided by the University of Heidelberg
(see http://comopt.ifi.uni-heidelberg.de/software/TSPLIB95/).

With the following code, we extract the values from the data as a list of lists of
integers, and undo the mentioned replacement.

   ...           for line in data_of_TSP_br17.splitlines()]


**The algorithm**

For solving problems like the given one, we define the following function
*demo_traveling_salesman*.
It implements a problem reduction in the three parts explained above. The
traveling salesman problem is reduced to a single source shortest paths problem
in a search graph.

Part 1: It defines a new graph as follows, in the lazy style of NoGraphs:

- A **vertex** in the new graph is a state of our search in the original graph. Such a
  state consists of a
  **tuple** of the **current vertex** and the
  **set of vertices that are still to be visited.**
- An **edge** in the new graph is the
  **transition from a search state to one of the possible next search states**, where
  we have chosen one of the vertices we still had to visit, with the weight according
  to the input graph, and a next state, that consists of the chosen vertex and the
  set of vertices still to be visited when we have visited the chosen one.
  When there is no further vertex to visit any more, there is just one edge from
  the current vertex, and this leads back to the start vertex.

Part 2: It applies `TraversalShortestPaths` on this graph, starting at a start state
that consists of vertex 0 (an arbitrary choice) and the set of all other vertices
as the vertices still to be visited.

It finds the shortest path and its weight when it reaches the first state in a search
depth that equals the number of vertices of the original graph, because
*TraversalShortestPaths* reports paths ordered by ascending length.

Part 3: The length of the computed path is directly the length of the shortest
traveling salesman path. And in each state of the computed path, we find the vertex
visited in this state. So, we can create the path that solves the traveling salesman
problem by extracting these vertices.

(Currently, I call this the *Melcher reduction from TSP to Dijkstra shortest paths*.
Most probably, the algorithm already exists somewhere in the literature. But maybe
not :-). Please inform me if you know a reference.)

   ...            return length, path, no_of_visited_states / no_of_possible_states
   ...    raise RuntimeError("No solution found")


**Applying the algorithm**

Now, we call *traveling_salesman* to solve our problem:

.. code-block:: python

   >>> length, path_iterator, percentage_visited = demo_traveling_salesman(graph)
   >>> print(length, list(path_iterator), f"{percentage_visited:.0%}")
   39 [0, 11, 13, 2, 12, 10, 9, 1, 16, 8, 7, 4, 3, 15, 14, 6, 5, 0] 23%


The described algorithm profits from the fact that the Dijkstra algorithm implemented
by *TraversalShortestPaths* visits only the vertices (here: search states) that need to
be visited in order to report shortest paths in ascending order - and we can stop the
computation immediately when we first found a complete loop.
This means,
**due to the lazy approach of NoGraphs,** the
traveling salesman **search graph is often only partially build**.
In the example, only 23% of the possible search states (and their outgoing edges)
have been generated.
This adds up with the advantage of NoGraphs, that edges are generated and
consumed on the fly, but they are not stored.

Note: Dynamic programming algorithms can also show these two advantages - but
explicit graphs as used by typical graph libraries cannot provide them.

.. _tsp_in_nographs:

**The TSP-solving function in the extras section of NoGraphs**

.. versionadded:: 3.3

NoGraphs contains a function *traveling_salesman(vertices, weights)*,
a more general version of the above algorithm
(see `API  <nographs.traveling_salesman>`):

- It can also handle **negative edge weights**,
- can also search for the **longest TSP path**, and
- can search for TSP **tours in subsets of the vertices** of a graph.
- Weights can be given in several forms:
  **Nested tuples, nested lists or nested dicts**. And
  **None as weight, or raising an exception on accessing a weight signals**
  **having no edges** from the respective vertex or between the
  respective vertices.

Its implementation is also more optimized:

- It is based on the bidirectional search `BSearchShortestPath` instead of
  the traversal `TraversalShortestPaths`.
- Internally, it uses bit arrays instead of sets and tuples as representation
  of search states.

In the following, we apply it to the `above problem <traveling_salesman_example>`:

.. code-block:: python

   >>> length, path_iterator = nog.traveling_salesman(range(len(graph)), graph)  #doctest:+SLOW_TEST
   >>> print(length, list(path_iterator))  #doctest:+SLOW_TEST
   39 [0, 5, 6, 14, 15, 3, 4, 16, 8, 7, 12, 10, 9, 1, 13, 2, 11, 0]

Of cause, it computes the same optimal TSP path length. But it returns another path of
this length here: there are several optimal TSP routes for the problem.

Please note: For computing exact solutions of large TSP instances like they occur in
real-life scenarios, highly elaborated, specialized algorithms on very performant
platforms are needed.
`nographs.traveling_salesman` can only solve relatively small instances
(with maybe up to 60 vertices), although, typically, it is faster than
schoolbook-implementations of
the `Held-Karp algorithm <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Held%E2%80%93Karp_algorithm>`_.


.. _infinite_branching:

Example: Shortest paths in infinitely branching graphs with sorted edges
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**The Problem**

We have a  graph, defined on the positive integers as
vertices. We like to start at vertex 1, iterate the shortest
paths from there in ascending order, and report vertices with a distance that equals
the vertex itself. We will explain the purpose later on.

First, let's have a look on the graph:

.. code-block:: python

   >>> import itertools
   >>> def next_edges_prime_search(i, distance):
   ...     yield i+1, (i+1) - distance
   ...     if i > 1:
   ...         for i_next in itertools.count(i*i, i):
   ...             yield i_next, (i_next - distance) - 0.5

For vertices larger than 1, the graph has
**infinitely many outgoing edges per vertex** (see the *for*-loop).
This is called an *infinitely branching graph*.
NoGraphs itself cannot analyze such graphs.

**The algorithm**

Although NoGraphs cannot analyze such graphs, we can still analyze the graph
using NoGraphs - in combination with problem reduction:

We search in a search graph, not directly in the given graph. The idea of the
search graph is, that **instead of having infinitely many edges** starting
at a vertex, we have an
**infinite chain of vertices** starting there, and
**from each of these, a single edge** to
an end vertex of one of the original edges.
The vertices in such a chain are connected by edges with lengths that
equal the **length difference** between consecutive edges of the original graph.
We get non-negative edge lengths because the original edges where given in ascending
order.

Here is the mapping:

- The vertices of the search graph are states of our search in the original graph.
  Such a state is a tuple (*vertex*, *edge_no*), where *vertex* is a vertex of the
  original graph, and *edge_no* is the number of an outgoing edge of this vertex.
- Edges in the search graph go from (*vertex*, *edge_no*) both to:

  - (*vertex*, *edge_no* + 1), i.e., we continue to further edges starting at *vertex*,
    and
  - (*end_vertex*, 0), i.e., we continue to the end vertex of the current edge.

In the following, you find the code for the problem reduction. For the
purpose of this section, it suffices to understand the idea as described above.
The details of the code are not needed.

   ...     # Extract vertices from the reported base states "vertex, first edge"
   ...     return ((v, traversal.distance) for v, edge_no in traversal if edge_no == 0)


**Applying the algorithm**

Based on this implementation of the problem reduction, we can now solve our given problem:

.. code-block:: python

   >>> t = traversal_shortest_paths_inf_branching_sorted(next_edges_prime_search, 1)
   >>> primes = (i for i, distance in t if i == distance)

And what we get is: An infinite generator of primes. Let's test it:

.. code-block:: python

   >>> from itertools import takewhile
   >>> list(takewhile(lambda i: i<=50, primes))
   [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47]

The graph defined above and the filter *i == distance* is an alternative
implementation of the idea described in section `search_aware_graphs`.
Please see there, if you like to know how it works.


.. tip::

    When defining and using complex problem reductions, it is recommended to develop not
    only the code, but also some kind of correction proof. For the given example, this
    could look like the following (briefly sketched):

    - Well-defined graph for shortest paths computation:

      The edge weight of the first computed edge per vertex is non-negative. Thus,
      also the weight of the respective edge of the synthetic graph is non-negative.

      And the original graph computes its edges for a given (positive) vertex in
      ascending order. Thus, the edge weights of the synthetic graph, that are computed
      as difference of two consecutive edge weights of the original graph, are also
      all positive.

      So, it is allowed to apply the Dijkstra single source shortest paths algorithm.

    - Correctness of the problem reduction:

      By duality of the original graph and the synthetic graph.

      This means: Since we get correct results by the Dijkstra algorithms, we also
      get correct results by the problem reduction.

    - Next result requires only a finite number of computation steps:

      We know, that for the n-th prime *p_n*, with *n > 1*, the (n+1)-th prime
      *p_m* is lower than *2*p_n*
      (`Bertrand's postulate <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrand%27s_postulate>`_).
      But what we still need to make sure is, that if we compute a shortest
      path to each of the numbers *p_n*, *p_n + 1*, ..., *p_m*, each of these
      computations requires only finitely many computation steps.

      We know: All edges of the original graph have weights that are larger than a
      fixed lower bound, here, their weights are at least 0.5. So, when the next
      vertex with the next longer distance is computed, the search
      graph to be regarded contains only finitely many vertices and edges.
      And in such a case, the Dijkstra algorithm needs only finitely many
      computation steps to produce the next shortest path (resp. its end vertex
      and distance from the start).


.. _infinite_branching_in_nographs:

**Functionality for infinitely branching graphs in the extras section of NoGraphs**

.. versionadded:: 3.3

NoGraphs contains a class *TraversalShortestPathsInfBranchingSorted*,
a more general version of the above algorithm
(see `API  <nographs.TraversalShortestPathsInfBranchingSorted>`).
Its signature is more adapted to the other classes in NoGraphs, and it can also
generate paths.

   [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47]

No, we also ask for paths, and report the predecessor of each non-prime number as
(one of) its divisors. We go till 20.

.. _longest_path_two_vertices:

Example: Longest simple path between two vertices - based on DFS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionadded:: 3.4

Our goal is to compute the longest (simple) path from a given vertex *v* to another
given vertex *w*.

**Problem 1: Search for longest path w.r.t. the sum of edge weights**

First, we use a weighted graph, and we define the length of a path by the
sum of the weights of its edges.

We re-use the graph and the function *neighbors_in_grid* from example
`shortest paths in a maze with weights <example-shortest-paths-in-maze>`.
This time, our edge weights are the energy needed for walking
uphill (here: just the height difference) or
downhill (here: half the height difference).

   ...     pos_x, pos_y = position
   ...     for move_x, move_y in (-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1):
   ...         new_x, new_y = pos_x + move_x, pos_y + move_y
   ...         if new_x in range(5) and new_y in range(5):
   ...             yield new_x, new_y

.. code-block:: python

   ...     position_height = int(data[y][x])
   ...     for x, y in neighbors_in_grid(position):
   ...         successor_height = int(data[y][x])
   ...         slope = successor_height - position_height
   ...         energy = slope if slope >= 0 else -slope/2
   ...         yield (x, y), energy


**The algorithm**

We traverse all possible paths from the start vertex using
*depth first search*. We maintain the length of the path: When we enter
a vertex, we add the length of the edge we used to the length of the path,
and when we leave a vertex, we subtract the length of the edge that we use
for backtracking.
When we reach the destination node, we prevent the path from being extended
any further. And we maintain the longest path found so far, and its length.

.. code-block:: python

    (85.5,

**Problem 2: Search for longest path w.r.t. the number of edges**

Next, we define the length of a path by the number of its edges.

For this, we just assign weight *1* to each edge that we generate in our
`NextEdges` function.

   ...     for x, y in neighbors_in_grid(position):

.. _strongly_connected_components:

Example: Strongly connected components - based on DFS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionadded:: 3.4

**The Problem**

Our goal is to compute the
`strongly connected components <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strongly_connected_component>`_
of a graph.
A *directed graphs is said to be strongly connected* if every vertex is reachable from
every other vertex. The *strongly connected components of a directed graph* form a
partition into subgraphs that are themselves strongly connected.

Here is our graph:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> edges = {0: (1, 2), 1: (0, 3), 2: (0, 3), 3: (5,), 4: (2, 5, 7), 5: (3, 8),
    ...          6: (4,), 7: (5, 6), 8: (), 9: (8,)}
    >>> vertices = edges.keys()
    >>> def next_vertices(v, _):
    ...     return edges[v]


**The algorithm**

We want to **implement a non-recursive version of the**
`algorithm of Tarjan
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarjan%27s_strongly_connected_components_algorithm>`_.

We **use the non-recursive implementation of DFS in NoGraphs as basis** for this.
We turn on exactly the functionalities of this implementation that we need.

According to the algorithm, we need to do the following:

- We number the vertices in the so-called pre-oder, i.e., vertices get their
  number when they are visited.

  NoGraphs can compute this pre-preorder index for us.
  We turn on this feature of the DFS implementation: *compute_index=True*.

- We maintain a stack and place nodes on the stack in the order in which they are
  visited. And we maintain the so-called *low_link*, the smallest index of any node
  on the stack known to be reachable from *v* through *v*'s DFS subtree, including *v*
  itself. We implement both the stack and the *low_link*-mapping in a single *dict*.

  When we backtrack from a vertex *v*, and its *low_link* equals its index, we
  pop all vertices from the stack till we reach *v* and report these vertices
  as component. *v* is the root of the component.

  For these steps, we can also use NoGraphs:

  - We need to know when one of the following events occurs during the
    traversal: A vertex (a start vertex or a successor) is entered, an edge of the
    DFS-tree is followed, a vertex is left (backtracking), or some non-tree edge
    is seen.

    We turn on the respective reporting:
    *report=nog.DFSEvent.IN_OUT | nog.DFSEvent.SOME_NON_TREE_EDGE*.

  - And we need access to the predecessor of a vertex when an edge is followed or
    when the traversal backtracks.

    For this, we switch on the computation of
    the trace (current path from a start vertex to the current vertex):
    *compute_trace=True*.

Now, we can directly implement the steps that need to happen when the different
events occur:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> def tarjan_strongly_connected_components(next_vertices, start_vertices):
    ...     traversal = nog.TraversalDepthFirst(next_vertices)
    ...     _ = traversal.start_from(
    ...         start_vertices=start_vertices, compute_trace=True, compute_index=True,
    ...         report=nog.DFSEvent.IN_OUT | nog.DFSEvent.SOME_NON_TREE_EDGE)
    ...     trace, index = traversal.trace, traversal.index
    ...
    ...     # Stack of vertices, and the *low_link* values computed for them
    ...     low_link = dict()
    ...     # Iterate the occurring events and the respective vertices:
    ...     for v in traversal:
    ...         event = traversal.event
    ...         if event in nog.DFSEvent.ENTERING:
    ...             # Entering a new vertex via an edge of the DFS-tree:
    ...             # Push v on the stack, store index as low_link
    ...             low_link[v] = index[v]
    ...             continue
    ...         if event == nog.DFSEvent.SOME_NON_TREE_EDGE and v in low_link:
    ...             # A non-tree edge (predecessor, v), and v is on the stack:
    ...             # Update low_link of predecessor w.r.t. the index of v
    ...             if (v_index:=index[v]) < low_link[predecessor:=trace[-2]]:
    ...                   low_link[predecessor] = v_index
    ...             continue
    ...         if event == nog.DFSEvent.LEAVING_SUCCESSOR:
    ...             # Backtracking from an edge (predecessor, v) of the DFS-tree:
    ...             # Update low_link of predecessor w.r.t. low_link of v
    ...             if (v_low_link:=low_link[v]) < low_link[predecessor:=trace[-2]]:
    ...                 low_link[predecessor] = v_low_link
    ...         if event in nog.DFSEvent.LEAVING and low_link[v] == index[v]:
    ...             # Leaving a vertex of the DFS-tree that is root of a component
    ...             # (the lowest link reachable from it is itself):
    ...             # Pop from the stack and report till the component root is reached
    ...             component = []
    ...             while True:
    ...                w, l = low_link.popitem()
    ...                component.append(w)
    ...                del index[w]  # We do not need the index number of w anymore
    ...                if v == w: break
    ...             yield component


**Applying the algorithm**

And here are the strongly connected components of the graph:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> list(tarjan_strongly_connected_components(next_vertices, vertices))
    [[8], [5, 3], [1, 2, 0], [6, 7, 4], [9]]

Like this, the **TraversalDepthFirst of NoGraphs simplifies**
**the implementation of non-recursive DFS-based algorithms**.

Note that the implementation reports components immediately when it identifies them.
And it only traverses the part of the diagram that is necessary to identify them. The
**lazy evaluation style of TraversalDepthFirst thus carries over** to the calculation
of the components. For example, it is possible to calculate components only until a
component with certain properties has been found.



.. _biconnected_components:

Example: Biconnected components of a connected undirected graph - based on DFS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. versionadded:: 3.4

**The problem**

Our goal is to compute the
`biconnected components <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biconnected_component>`_
(sometimes also called *2-connected component*) of a graph
.

The *undirected graph* is represented as a symmetric directed graph,
i.e., for each edge *(v, w)* in the graph, *(w, v)* also is an edge in the graph.
The graph is *connected*, i.e., every vertex is reachable from every other vertex.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from collections import defaultdict
    >>> successors = defaultdict(list)
    >>> for v, w in (
    ...     ("MY", "GYB"), ("GYB", "GS"), ("GS", "S"),
    ...     ("MY", "TM"), ("GYB", "B"), ("GYB", "G0"), ("GS", "G1"),
    ...     ("TM", "RT"), ("G0", "G2"), ("G1", "G2"), ("G1", "G3"),
    ...     ("RT", "R0"), ("G2", "G3"),
    ...     ("RT", "R1"), ("R0", "R2"),
    ...     ("R1", "R2"),
    ... ):
    ...     successors[v].append(w)
    ...     successors[w].append(v)

(The names of the vertices are chosen to represent the first letters of the colors
red, turquoise, yellow, blue, green, and stone grey of the example graph in the
above mentioned Wikipedia article. This makes it
easy the match the graph and the results that we will get to the example
- at least as long as the article uses the example...)

A connected undirected graph is said to be *biconnected*
if it has more than 2 vertices and remains connected when a vertex is removed.
A *biconnected component* is a maximal biconnected subgraph.


**The algorithm**

We want to implement a
**non-recursive version of the algorithm of Hopcroft and Tarjan**
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biconnected_component).

**We use the non-recursive implementation of DFS in NoGraphs as basis** for this.
We turn on exactly the functionalities of this implementation that we need.

The algorithm is based on the following elements:

- We need to store the parent of each visited vertex

  NoGraphs can do this for us - we could just use option *compute_paths*, and the
  path container stores the predecessors for us.

  But although the algorithm maintains all these parents, it only uses the
  parent of the current vertex or the parent of the parent. These vertices
  are part of the trace (current path from a start vertex to the current vertex).

  A single trace is less data than the whole predecessor relation for all paths,
  so we choose to switch on the computation of the trace:
  *compute_trace=True*.

- We need to maintain the search depths of all visited vertices

  When the DFS traversal enters a vertex, we store the DFS search depth of
  the vertex in a dict.

  NoGraphs can compute the search depth of the current vertex. But we do not use
  this feature, because when a vertex is entered, we already know its
  search depth: it equals *len(trace) - 1*.

- We need to compute and store the so-called *lowpoint* of a vertex *v*, when the
  traversal leaves the vertex:

  This lowpoint is the minimum of the depth of v, the depth of all neighbors
  of v (other than the parent of v in the depth-first-search tree) and the lowpoint of
  all children of v in the depth-first-search tree.

  And if condition
  *low_point(y) â‰¥ depth(v)*
  holds, *v* is an articulation point.

  - For these steps of the algorithm,
    we need to know when one of the following events occurs during the
    traverse: A vertex (a start vertex or a successor) is entered, an edge of the
    DFS-tree is followed, a vertex is left (backtracking along an edge of the
    DFS-tree), or some non-tree edge
    is seen.

    We turn on the respective reporting:
    *report=nog.DFSEvent.IN_OUT | nog.DFSEvent.SOME_NON_TREE_EDGE*.

Now, we can directly implement the steps that need to happen when the different
events occur:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> def hopcroft_tarjan_articulation_points(next_vertices, any_vertex, lowpoint_dict=None):

    ...             if dfs_children_of_start > 1:
    ...                 yield v

The steps, that are needed to compute the found biconnected component
when an articulation point is reported, do not need any graph traversal. So, we
implement them without using NoGraphs. It's a simple loop that extracts data
from a *dict*.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> def hopcroft_tarjan_biconnected_components(articulation_point, lowpoint_dict):
    ...     """ Report the biconnected component from *data_dict*,
    ...     the mapping from a vertex to its *lowpoint* value, in insertion order.
    ...     The function can only be used

    ...     articulation point, and then only once. """
    ...     component = []
    ...     while True:
    ...         # Get all vertices of the DFS tree (in its current state) that starts
    ...         # at the articulation point. Use the lowpoint dictionary, and
    ...         # remove all vertices except for the articulation point itself, as
    ...         # it will be part of other components that we report later on.
    ...         vertex, low_point_value = lowpoint_dict.popitem()
    ...         component.append(vertex)
    ...         if vertex == articulation_point:
    ...             lowpoint_dict[vertex] = low_point_value
    ...             return component


**Applying the algorithm**

Now, we can compute the articulation points of the graph:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> def next_vertices(v, _):
    ...     return successors[v]
    >>> start_vertex = next(iter(successors.keys()))

    >>> articulation_points = set(
    ...     hopcroft_tarjan_articulation_points(next_vertices, start_vertex))
    >>> list(sorted(articulation_points))
    ['GS', 'GYB', 'MY', 'RT', 'TM']


Next, we repeat the computation, but this time we ask for the biconnected components
(we could also get both parts of the result in a single run by storing the
articulation points in a set):

.. code-block:: python

    >>> lowpoint_dict = dict()
    >>> for articulation_point in (
    ...     hopcroft_tarjan_articulation_points(next_vertices, start_vertex, lowpoint_dict)
    ... ):
    ...     print(hopcroft_tarjan_biconnected_components(articulation_point, lowpoint_dict))
    ['R0', 'R2', 'R1', 'RT']
    ['RT', 'TM']
    ['S', 'GS']
    ['GS', 'G1', 'G3', 'G2', 'G0', 'GYB']
    ['B', 'GYB']
    ['GYB', 'TM', 'MY']

Note that, like in the previous section, the implementation reports results
immediately when it identifies them, and it only traverses the part of the diagram
that is necessary to identify them. The lazy evaluation style of TraversalDepthFirst
thus carries over to the calculation of the articulation points and the components.
For example, it is possible to calculate components only until a component with
certain properties has been found.
